To get results excatly like my screenshot all you need to do is:
- Turn on "Coloured Text" in "Core" settings.
- Download [BetterRoleColors](https://github.com/rauenzi/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Plugins/BetterRoleColors) and leave everything to defult.

Please also note, that I will be constantly updating this theme.
